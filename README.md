You can copy only `build` directory to root of your project and include style sheet line into \<HEAD/\> of your HTML file.
`\<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.icon-large.css" /\>`

To change icons to 32x32 in your bootstrap project you should add class `icon-large`.
`\<i class="icon-large icon-power"\>\</i\>`

There are new sets of icons
icon-large		32x32
icon-medium		24x24
icon-standard	16x16
icon-mini		12x12
icon-new		14x14

You must use Twitter Bootstrap too from http://twitter.github.com
